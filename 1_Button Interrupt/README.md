This program sets the button as an input and the LED as an ouput. The program sets up the interupts to catch any button presses then puts the CPU to sleep to save power. The CPU will only wake up when the button is pressed. On a button press the CPU wakes up and runs the interupt code. In this case, the code will toggle the LED then reset the interupt flag.
