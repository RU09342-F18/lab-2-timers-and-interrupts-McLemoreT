This program sets up an LED as an output then sets up a timer and interupts. After the setup is complete the CPU is put to sleep. The cpu rests until a predefined number is reached by the timer. The timer calls an interupt, which runs code to toggle the LED. The timer continues counting in the background, waiting until that same number is hit again.
