This program starts by initalizeing the button as an input and the LED as an output. Next, a timer and interupts are set up. The timer is divided to be slower than ussual. This program has the user press abutton, which is recorded. The timer then counts up until the user relases the button. When the user releses the button the timer position is recorded again. This is used to measure how long the LED will stay on/off for. The interupt code is then set to run when ever the timer reaches one of the two timer positions previously recorded.
